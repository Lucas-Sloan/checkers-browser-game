•	Checkers move diagonally on dark squares only.

•	At the start, checkers move forward towards the opponent's side.

•	Each turn, move one checker one space, unless jumping.

•	Players alternate turns, each moving their checker forward diagonally.

•	If a jump lands you in position to jump another opponent's checker, you can make a “double jump” in one move.

•	A double jump involves making two jumps consecutively within a single turn.

•	Once a checker becomes a “king” by reaching the last row, it can move diagonally forward or backward.

•	The game is won by capturing all of the opponent's checkers.

•	Players continue jumping to capture checkers until one color remains on the board.
