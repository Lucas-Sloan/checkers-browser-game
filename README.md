Title:
Checkers

Description:
In this Checkers game, the black pieces move first, and all moveable pieces are highlighted for easy gameplay. Players take turns moving one checker one space diagonally on the dark squares, with the primary objective of advancing their pieces forward towards the opponent's side. Captures must be made whenever possible during a turn, and successful captures allow for additional "double jumps" if another capture is possible. When a checker reaches the opponent's last row, it becomes a "king" and gains the ability to move diagonally both forward and backward. The game is won by capturing all of the opponent's checkers, with players continuing to jump and capture until only one color remains on the board.

Background:
I chose this Checkers game because the alternating turns and board layout reminded me of a tic-tac-toe game I previously created. Although it turned out to be much more complex, I enjoyed the challenge of designing the checkerboard pattern. It involved setting up coordinates, determining possible moves, and implementing the movement and capture logic, all of which were rewarding to figure out.

Future Goals:
A future goal for this Checkers game is to add computer logic to enable single-player gameplay. This would involve creating an AI opponent that can make strategic moves, adding a new layer of challenge and engagement for players. This addition would make the game more versatile, allowing solo players to enjoy a competitive experience.
